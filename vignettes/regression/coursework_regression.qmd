## The Problem

Data on [Energy Certificates](https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/) were downloaded in March 2025. These certificates are a non-random sample of UK housing, and contain information such as:

- Property energy efficiency: The core data is the energy efficiency rating, which ranges from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient).
- CO2 emissions: The data includes information on the building's likely carbon dioxide emissions.
- Energy costs: Potential costs for heating and lighting the property are provided.
- Improvement recommendations: Each EPC lists cost-effective ways to improve the building's energy performance.

We have been asked by a local company to determine whether some local authorities are better than others in terms of reducing the carbon footprint of properties in their area.  However, some authorities have older housing stock which is innately has a larger carbon footprint. Likewise, some have larger properties than others.  The initial brief is to carry out an aggregate data analysis where the unit of analysis is a local authority.  We have been asked to consider the average carbon footprint of a house in a given area conditional on being pre- or post-1930 and having between 1 and 10 heated rooms.  This should let you fit a model which has fixed effects for the number of houses of pre-1930, post-1930 and 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 heated rooms


$$Y_{ji} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{j}^{(\text{old})} + \sum_{r=1}^{10} \beta_r x_{j}^{(r)} + \gamma_j$$

Where 

- $Y_{ji}$ is the average carbon dioxide emissions for authority $j$ for each house type $i$ (old/new, 1, 2, ..., 10 rooms)
- $x_{j}^{(old)}$ is the number of houses that are older than 1930 in authority $j$
- $x_{j}^r$ are the number of houses with $r=1, 2, ..., 10$ rooms in authority $j$ 
- $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_r$ are the fixed effects
- $\gamma_j$ is the random effect for local authority $j$




## The Data

Some initial exploratory data analysis shows us how the carbon emissions vary by age of property and by the number of rooms:



![](boxplot_age.html){width="100%" height="600px"}

This box plot compares the shortfall of houses with age, in the case shortfall means how far a property falls short of a target level of carbon performance or energy efficiency. It shows that older properties have a higher and more varied shortfall compared to the more recent ones. The medium line is clearly higher for older properties and its interquatile range is larger suggesting that a greater spread in performance. Old properties also have more high outliers suggesting that a group of them perform particularly worse. Overall the box plot shows that older properties have a higher shortfall and are more varied where as recent builing perfom more constitanlty and better.  

![](boxplot_rooms.html){width="100%" height="600px"} 

This box plot compares shortfall of properties with differnt number of rooms. The plot clearly shows a positive increase of shortfall and variation as the number of rooms goes up. What I think stands out is that properties with 1 room have a higher lower quatile range, medium, upper quartile range, outliers and more variablity compared to properties with two rooms. This suggests that although shortfall generally increases with property size, very small properties exhibit more inconsistent performance compared with slightly larger ones.


## The model

After fitting the model above we get a summary of the fixed effects produced.


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: 'asis'
with open('../../data_cache/vignettes/regression/model_fit.txt') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
```
These results show that more recent properties have a lower shortfall than others. The coefficient for age(T.Recent) is –2.98, which means that recent houses have almost 3 units less shortfall than old houses, this results is statistically significant because the z (-65) score is much larger than 2. These results also show there is a relationship between the number of rooms to shortfall because the coefficient for n_rooms is +1.054, meaning each additional room increases shortfall by about 1 unit. The group variance is 0.434 which suggest that shortfall is varied across different local authorities, as in some local authorities have a more efficient set of properties. Overall the results show new and smaller properties perform better and local authorities vary. 

## The key insight

We've been asked to rate local authority performance, so the most important result is a ``caterpillar plot'' of the random effects.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: 'asis'
import pandas as pd
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Make sure project root is added
project_root = Path().resolve().parents[1]
sys.path.append(str(project_root))

# Load your data FIRST
df = pd.read_csv(project_root / "data_cache" / "la_energy.csv")
print(df.columns)
# Import your model functions
from course.regression.fit_model import _fit_model
results = _fit_model(df)


# Save fitted values and residuals for each model
df["fitted_linear"] = results.fittedvalues
df["resid_linear"]  = results.resid




import plotly.express as px

fig = px.scatter(
    df,
    x="fitted_linear",
    y="resid_linear",
    title="Residuals vs Fitted – Linear Model",
    labels={"fitted_linear": "Fitted values", "resid_linear": "Residuals"}
)
fig.add_hline(y=0)  # optional reference line
fig.show()
```

This is a residual vs fitted value plot, it clearly shows a U shaped (or quadratic) which shows that the relationship between the predictors and the response variable are not linear. In a well fitted model the residuals should be scattered around 0 in this one however we see curvature. Residuals are positive for small fitted values, negative in the middle and strongly positive at larger fitted values. This suggests that the model is not capturing the true relationship so may require additional predictors or nonlinear transforms.
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: 'asis'
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Extract residuals
residuals = results.resid

# Compute theoretical quantiles and sample quantiles
theoretical_quantiles = np.sort(stats.norm.ppf(np.linspace(0.001, 0.999, len(residuals))))
sample_quantiles = np.sort(residuals)

# Create QQ plot
fig = go.Figure()

fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x=theoretical_quantiles,
    y=sample_quantiles,
    mode='markers',
    name='Residuals',
    marker=dict(color='royalblue', size=5)
))

# Add 45-degree line
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x=theoretical_quantiles,
    y=theoretical_quantiles,
    mode='lines',
    name='45° Line',
    line=dict(color='red', dash='dash')
))

fig.update_layout(
    title="QQ Plot of Residuals",
    xaxis_title="Theoretical Quantiles",
    yaxis_title="Sample Quantiles",
    template="simple_white"
)

fig.show()
```
As we cannot be satisfied with checking the models validity with one test I used a QQ-plot 
This QQ-plot fo the model shows that the residuals are not normally distributed because there is a clear deviation from the 45 degree line especially on the right tail side. This suggest that the model is not capturing non-linear relationships and the data is  heteroscedastic. 

Overall the model diagnostics show that some of the assumptions needed for the model to work are not met. The residual vs fitted scatter plot shows clear heteroscedasticity and nonlinear patterns. The QQ-plot reinforces both of these finding as well as showing that the model is not normally distributed. Both plots show that shortfall decreases slightly at small numbers of rooms then starts to increase with number of rooms(we saw this in the boxplot) therefore the model is missing key predictors. 

A sensible next step would be to explore alternative models such as adding non-linear terms to better capture the patterns shown above. 


## Adding a non linear term 

As we have see above in the residual vs fitted scatter-plot there is an almost quadratic graph. Therefore i decided to add a quadratic term into the model. 

$$Y_{ji} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{j}^{(\text{old})} + \sum_{r=1}^{10} \beta_r x_{j}^{(r)} + (\sum_{r=1}^{10} \beta_r x_{j}^{(r)})^2 + \gamma_j$$


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: 'asis'
with open('../../data_cache/vignettes/regression/model2_fit.txt') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
```
Fitting the quadratic model improves the results slightly by allowing some curvature between the predictors and shortfall. The negative linear term (–0.804) combined with the positive quadratic term (0.169) indicates a U-shaped relationship, where shortfall initially decreases as the number of rooms increases, but begins to rise again for properties with a larger number of rooms. This is what we observed in the box plot above (Properties with 1 room seemed to have a higher shortfall than with 2 and 3 rooms). The age coeffiecnt remains the same and still is statistically significant. The random-effects variance (0.514) suggests that there still is group variation likely caused by different local authorities. 



Checking the model diagnostics using a residual vs fitted plot and a QQ-plot

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: 'asis'
import pandas as pd
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Make sure project root is added
project_root = Path().resolve().parents[1]
sys.path.append(str(project_root))

# Load your data FIRST
df = pd.read_csv(project_root / "data_cache" / "la_energy.csv")

# Import your model functions
from course.regression.Quadratic_fit import _fit_modelQ
results = _fit_modelQ(df)


# Save fitted values and residuals for each model
df["fitted_Quadratic"] = results.fittedvalues
df["resid_Quadratic"]  = results.resid




import plotly.express as px

fig = px.scatter(
    df,
    x="fitted_Quadratic",
    y="resid_Quadratic",
    title="Residuals vs Fitted – Quadratic Model",
    labels={"fitted_Quadratic": "Fitted values", "resid_Quadratic": "Residuals"}
)
fig.add_hline(y=0)  # optional reference line
fig.show()
```

After adding the quadratic term in the model the U-shaped has reduced however it is still present. This means that the new model is still not normally distributed and therefore still not suitable. Also the spread of residuals increases for higher fitted values, indicating heteroscedasticity. 

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: 'asis'
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Extract residuals
residuals = results.resid

# Compute theoretical quantiles and sample quantiles
theoretical_quantiles = np.sort(stats.norm.ppf(np.linspace(0.001, 0.999, len(residuals))))
sample_quantiles = np.sort(residuals)

# Create QQ plot
fig = go.Figure()

fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x=theoretical_quantiles,
    y=sample_quantiles,
    mode='markers',
    name='Residuals',
    marker=dict(color='royalblue', size=5)
))

# Add 45-degree line
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x=theoretical_quantiles,
    y=theoretical_quantiles,
    mode='lines',
    name='45° Line',
    line=dict(color='red', dash='dash')
))

fig.update_layout(
    title="QQ Plot of Residuals",
    xaxis_title="Theoretical Quantiles",
    yaxis_title="Sample Quantiles",
    template="simple_white"
)

fig.show()
```

The QQ-plot for the new model confirms the non-normality indicated in the plot above. While the central portion of the residual distribution lies close to the 45° reference line, both tails depart dramatically (the right hand side even more so).
What i find interesting is that in all 4 of the plots the right and tail has been really high meaning that both models fail to predict a subset of variables that have an unusually high shortfall which may be because there are systematically extreme values in the data. The next steps should therefore focus on addressing these distributional problems
